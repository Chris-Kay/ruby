<H1> Hello World </H1>
<p> Slow down, Bart! My legs dont know how to be as long as yours. Well, hes kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog </p>
<p> Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Homer no function beer well without. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! </p>
<p> Hello Hi </p>
